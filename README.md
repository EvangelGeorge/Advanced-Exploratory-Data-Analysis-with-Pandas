#  Advanced EDA with Pandas and Seaborn
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with IMDB Movies Dataset 
I did a practical class that focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Pandas library on an IMDB movies dataset. EDA involves data visualization, summary statistics, and insights extraction to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset.The EDA with IMDB Movies Dataset project demonstrates the application of Pandas for Exploratory Data Analysis. By utilizing Pandas' functionalities, this project aims to unveil insights from the IMDB movies dataset, including trends, correlations, and distribution patterns.
## Technologies Used
- Pandas library
- Seaborn library
- matplotlib library
